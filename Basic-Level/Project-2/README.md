## 📌Project Overview

In this project, we move beyond **beginner-level application deployment** and focus on deploying a **three-tier LAMP-based application**.

The application stack includes:

* **Linux** (Operating System)
* **Apache** (Web Server)
* **MySQL / MariaDB** (Database)
* **PHP / WordPress** (Application Layer)

This project is designed to help you understand how a real-world **three-tier architecture** works across different environments.

---

## Deployment Stages Covered

We will deploy the same LAMP application using the following approaches:

### 1️⃣ Local System (VM / Host Server)

* Traditional deployment on a virtual machine or physical server
* Helps build strong fundamentals of OS-level and service-based setup

I am using this website to deploy LAMP web application on local host system.

----------------------------------------------
### 2️⃣ Docker Containers (Using Dockerfile)

* Containerized deployment using Docker
* Application image built through a **Dockerfile**
* Focus on portability, isolation, and reproducibility




-----------------------------------------------
### 3️⃣ Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

* Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using:

  * **AWS EKS**
  * **Self-hosted kubeadm cluster**
* You may also practice using platforms like:

  * KillerKoda
  * KodeKloud
  * Minikube
  * KIND

-------------------------------------------------

## Learning Outcome

By completing this project, you will gain:

* A clear understanding of **three-tier application architecture**
* Hands-on experience with **VMs, containers, and Kubernetes**
* The ability to transition from **basic deployments to scalable, production-style setups**
* Confidence to work on **larger and more complex DevOps projects**
