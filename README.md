# Hello World!

This GitHub repository contains multiple folders, each with its own sub-files and a separate `README.md`.

## 🎯Mission

My mission is an ongoing journey. Through this repository, I aim to create lots of **core, real-world DevOps projects** for engineers who feel a lack of practical, hands-on project experience.

This repository covers:

* Application deployments from **scratch**
* Deployment across **all platforms and approaches**

  * Localhost / VM / Server
  * Docker (Dockerfile → Image → Container)
  * Kubernetes (K8s) cluster deployments
* Practical implementations of:

  * Basic applications
  * **2-tier and 3-tier architectures**
  * Web applications
  * Chatbots
  * Database-integrated systems
  * And many more real-world use cases

The goal is to build a **complete DevOps mindset**, not just theoretical knowledge.

## Open for Collaboration

I invite contributors from around the world to join this mission.
You are welcome to **contribute, learn, and showcase your work** as part of your professional job portfolio.

## Final Words

Thank you for being here.
Let’s work together on this mission—focused, practical, and without overthinking unnecessary things.
